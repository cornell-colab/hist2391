In pursuit of finding ways to better integrate text and images into coherent narratives, the students of the Cornell University undergraduate course HIST 22391: From Terra Incognita to Territories of Nation-States: Early American History in Two Dozen Maps learned and explored the exhibit tool Exhibit.so to create beautiful multimedia exhibitions displaying themes across historical maps of the United States.
This site holds all of the IIIF manifests and images processed by the Digital CoLab for HIST 22391: From Terra Incognita to Territories of Nation-States: Early American History in Two Dozen Maps. Manifests are ordered alphabetically and the labels will be the same as the individual image title in whatever repository the image is from.
