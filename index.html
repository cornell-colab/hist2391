<p>
In pursuit of finding ways to better integrate text and images into coherent narratives, the students of the Cornell University undergraduate course HIST 22391: From Terra Incognita to Territories of Nation-States: Early American History in Two Dozen Maps learned and explored the exhibit tool Exhibit.so to create beautiful multimedia exhibitions displaying themes across historical maps of the United States.
</p>
<p>
This site holds all of the IIIF manifests and images processed by the Digital CoLab for HIST 22391: From Terra Incognita to Territories of Nation-States: Early American History in Two Dozen Maps. Manifests are ordered alphabetically and the labels will be the same as the individual image title in whatever repository the image is from.
