  <h1>About this site</h1>

<p>
In pursuit of finding ways to better integrate text and images into coherent narratives, the brilliant students of the Cornell University undergraduate course HIST 22391: From Terra Incognita to Territories of Nation-States: Early American History in Two Dozen Maps learned and explored the exhibit tool <a href="https://www.exhibit.so">Exhibit.so</a> to create beautiful multimedia exhibitions displaying themes across historical maps of the United States.
</p>
<p>
This site holds all of the IIIF manifests and images processed by the Digital CoLab for the course. Manifests are ordered alphabetically and the labels will be the same as the individual image title in whatever repository the image is from. Maps are drawn from various places (included in the metadata), including the <a href="https://olinuris.library.cornell.edu/map-collection">Cornell University Library Map Collection</a>.
</p>
<p>
All credit for projects goes to the indivdiual students who worked hard to research and present their maps. Please see their original works on the <a href="https://cornell-colab.github.io/hist2391/projects/">Projects page</a>.
